Example:

Solving Costas Array Problem (-p costas) Size 20 (-s 20) using the cooperative multi-walks 
implementation (-m 1) composed by 4 teams (X10_NPLACES=4) each one  with 8 explorer 
nodes (-n 8), the intra team communication interval is 100 iterations (-i 100), the size of the 
pool is 2 spaces (-k 2), and running 50 samples (-b 50)


X10_NPLACES=4 X10_NTHREADS=16 ./MainSo -p costas -s 20 -m 1 -n 8 -i 100 -k 2 -b 50
